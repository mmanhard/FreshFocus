# Fresh Focus

Fresh Focus implements the Pomodoro technique but takes it one step further:
website blocking while in the middle of a Pomodoro session.

Using the extension is simple. Configure your Pomodoro sessions, start the session
timer, and your most distracting sites will be blocked and out of reach until the
session is over. If you've never used or heard of the Pomodoro technique before,
[this article](https://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-pomodoro-technique-1598992730)
does a great job of explaining it!

Fresh Focus was built with pure JS, CSS, and HTML.

## Usage

To use this extension, follow these simple steps in a Google Chrome browser:

1. Clone this repo to your machine.
2. Navigate to the Chrome extension manager: **chrome://extensions/**.
3. Select **"Load Unpacked"**.
4. Select the directory that contains the cloned repo.

After that, you're all set to try out the extension. Check it out in the
top-right corner of your Chrome browser.

## Why build Fresh Focus when there are other Pomodoro tools out there?

Two reasons.

The first is practical: Most of the tools out there give users the flexibility
of modifying the Pomodoro technique (e.g. changing length and number of sessions).
That being said, I couldn't find any that tackled the problem of eliminating
distractions. That's where website blocking comes into play.

The second is personal: This was my first foray into the world of web development.
I wanted to get more comfortable with writing plain-old Javascript and using
CSS/HTML. I also wanted to explore technologies like Local Storage and
understand how to interact with the DOM.
